## Automatic report

Once is deployed, send an automatic report with accounts status of your criptos.

## Starting 🚀
It is necessary an API key from Coinbase. You can create it in [this url](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api).

### Prerequisites 📋
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
- PHP version 8.3 or higher.

## Running 🛠️
`COINBASE_API_KEY` and `COINBASE_SECRET_API_KEY` must be set. Additionally, setting `COINBASE_USERNAME` is recommended for personalized emails.

After configuring these settings, fill in the `MAIL` variables. Alternatively, set `MAIL_MAILER` to `log` for local testing.

Set `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and `MAIL_FROM_NAME` with your email and name, and `MAIL_TO_ADDRESS` with the recipient's email.

Finally, set `MAIL_SCHEDULE_AT` to the desired time for the daily email report.
If everything is configured correctly, run `php artisan schedule:run` to send the email at the specified time.

That's it! Enjoy! 😉
